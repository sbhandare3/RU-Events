# RU-Events
There are around 400 student and faculty organizations around all Rutgers Campuses. These organizations have their own Facebook pages where they create new events. As a student surely you don't want to miss out on these events! RU Events fetches all the events from Facebook associated with Rutgers and notifies you! You can search events, RSVP to them and stay updated everyday!
